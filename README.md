## üìÇ Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict employee attrition and identify factors contributing to turnover.
- **Dataset:** HR dataset with 15,000 records including satisfaction level, evaluation scores, working hours, and salary.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

## üìä Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following columns:

- `satisfaction_level`: Employee satisfaction (0‚Äì1)
- `last_evaluation`: Last evaluation score
- `number_project`: Number of projects
- `average_montly_hours`: Average monthly working hours
- `time_spend_company`: Tenure in years
- `Work_accident`: Had a work accident (0/1)
- `left`: Employee left company (target)
- `promotion_last_5years`: Promotion in the last 5 years (0/1)
- `Department`: Department name
- `salary`: Salary category (low, medium, high)

The dataset contains 10 columns with both numerical and categorical variables.*

---

## üîç Key Insights
- Employees with **low satisfaction levels** and **very high or very low working hours** are more likely to leave.
- Attrition is higher among **low-salary employees** and **sales department staff**.
- Very few employees were promoted in the last 5 years.

## üìà Visualizations

### Feature Correlation Heatmap

The correlation heatmap confirms that the number of projects, monthly hours, and evaluation scores all have some positive correlation with each other, and whether an employee leaves is negatively correlated with their satisfaction level.

### Attrition rate by Salary Level

## üß† Model & Performance
Two models were tested:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier** (Best Performance)

### Metrics for Random Forest:
- **Accuracy:** ~97%
- **Precision:** 0.94
- **Recall:** 0.88
- **F1-score:** 0.91

## ‚úÖ Conclusions
- The analysis confirms that overwork and lack of career growth are key drivers of attrition at Salifort Motors. Employees with excessive workloads, long hours, and no promotions are more likely to leave.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Limit the number of projects per employee.

  - Reward or compensate overtime work and clearly communicate policies.

  - Consider promoting employees with longer tenure or investigate their dissatisfaction.

  - Promote a healthier work-life balance and transparent expectations.
